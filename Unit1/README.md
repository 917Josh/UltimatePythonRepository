## 1.1 Print Statements -

Try running the following code:

- printing with quotes

  ```python
  print("Hello world")
  ```

- printint without any quotes

  ```python
  print(Hello World)
  ```

- multiple lines of print statements

  ```python
  print("a")
  print("bc")
  print("de")
  ```

- printing arithmetic operations

  ```python
  print(2 + 5)
  print(3 * 3)
  print(2 + 2 * 10)
  print("2 + 2 * 10")
  ```

- using comments (ignored by computer, for humans to document their code to others/themselves)

  ```python
  print("Hours in a year:")
  print(365*24) # 365 days, 24 hours in each day
  ```

- using single quotes, so that you can print double quotes

  ```python
  print('Polonius advises, "To thine own self be true."')

  ```
